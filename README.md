# HomologicalAlgebra
My typed notes for the course Homological Algebra, followed in Bordeaux during the AY 2020-2021. 
These were intended to cover the whole course, including proofs.
Unfortunately I have not yet had time to finish them. In fact the first part is way more refined than the last part.

I will upload them here in the hope, some day, to find a bit of time to at least put an end
to the work I have left unfinished in the notes themeselves.
